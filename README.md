# General Search Algorithm

## How the Algorithm Works

The ```advanced_search()``` function takes in two arguments, the keywords of the search and the list to search it for. Instead of using the simple ```in``` keyword, this method iterates through the list and gets the letter matches in lower case with the keywords. The item that has the most matches is probably the closest match to an item in this list, hence the correct item is outputted.
